# Cursor Rules

## Ticket Catalogue Protocol (MANDATORY)

For ALL tasks (features, bugs, refactors):

1. **CHECK FIRST**: Read `./docs/tickets/tickets-index.json` for existing/related tickets
2. **FOUND?** → Update existing ticket → Resume work
3. **NOT FOUND?** → Create new ticket entry → Create detailed file in `docs/tickets/`
4. **DURING WORK**: Update progress, log issues, document plan changes
5. **ON COMPLETION**: Update status to "completed", update statistics

## 🔴 Feature Catalogue Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before modifying ANY code (UI, scripts):**
1. Read `docs/features/` to understand catalogue structure
2. Identify affected features in `docs/features/features-index.json`
3. Read existing feature docs for affected features

**After modifying ANY code:**
1. Update feature docs in `docs/features/`
2. Update `features-index.json` if new features added
3. Update related feature cross-references

**Non-compliance will cause code review rejection.**

## Architecture Clarifications (MANDATORY)

- **Frontend UI**: shadcn/ui is the primary UI system; **no competing UI frameworks**. Small MIT/Apache-2 shadcn-compatible component libs are allowed only when shadcn/ui lacks the capability and the exception is documented in `docs/features/**`.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with `cn()` utility for conditional classes.
- **Data fetching**: TanStack Query ONLY (no `useEffect` fetching).
- **Static export**: Next.js `output: 'export'` (SSG+CSR only), NO SSR, NO API routes.

- Follow `PLAYBOOK.md` for detailed workflow and quality rules.
- Requirements: chunk large inputs and verify EOF.
- Pause points: after plan, after implementation, before final deliverable.
